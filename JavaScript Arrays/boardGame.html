        Q2. In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided dice.
        If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.
        Can you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? Create a function that takes your position a and your
        friend's position b and returns a boolean representation of whether it's possible to earn a bonus on any dice
        roll.
        Examples
        possibleBonus(3, 7) true
        possibleBonus(1, 9) false
        possibleBonus(5, 3) false
        Note: -
        You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).
        If you are already on the same tile, return false, as you would be advancing away.
        Expect only positive integer inputs.

    console.log('possibleBonus(3,7): ', possibleBonus(3, 7));

    console.log('possibleBonus(1, 9): ', possibleBonus(1, 9));

    console.log('possibleBonus(5, 3): ', possibleBonus(5, 3));

    function possibleBonus(a, b) {
        flag = 0
        for (var i = 1; i < 7; i++) {
            if (a + i == b) {
                flag = 1
            }
        }
        if (flag == 1) return 1
        else return 0
    }
